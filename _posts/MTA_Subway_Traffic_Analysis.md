You are part of an organization that is sending out street teams to spread awareness of your organization
and increase attendance at a gala that your organization is hosting. How do you figure out the best time 
and place to send the street teams?     
  
Your first thought may be to send the teams to the place with the highest volume of foot traffic. One way to 
determine where these locations are would be to use MTA data collected at turnstiles in subway stops. The MTA audits every
turnstile at every station in 4 hour intervals and records a cumulative total of the entries and exits from that turnstile. 
With a little work you can find what 4 hour interval, on what day of the week, at which station the highest volumes of 
traffic occur.    
  
This data doesn't reach its true potential until some intuition is applied. Have you ever been approached by a person with 
a clipboard during rush hour or in an extremely busy place like Times Square? Chances are you didn't stop to take a closer 
look. That is why it may be best to avoid sending street teams to those places or to other places during rush hour. 
Additionally, there's a limit to the number of people a street team can talk to regardless of how high the volume of foot
traffic is.   
  
Another important factor in finding the best location to engage as many people as possible is the likelihood of someone
stopping. This is a function of many determinants. One determinant that should be considered is the interest of the traffic 
in your organization. If you were part of a technology organization it may be important to send out the teams to a location 
with a high density of tech companies.  
  
Although there are many other things to consider, picking the top, most obvious, variables is the best place to start.
In this case the MTA subway data seems to be the that place.
